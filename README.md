#Notes about the challenge
- I usually store the API key on a gitignore file.
Kinldy add your API KEY line 39 of the index.html file at the top of the script file line to make the API call.
- JavaScript file is generally not embedded in index.html.
I understood it was requested to show all the logic on one page.
I generally locate it in a js file and call it from the index.html page through a script tag.
- With extra time, I could have inserted the starting dates that I had retrieved from the Career Foundry API 
##Styles : 
- More could have been added:
- transition for the buttons
- Mobile Responsive
- Change date formats

Thank you for this great challenge!
